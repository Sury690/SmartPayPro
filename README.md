##  Project Overview

SmartPayPro is a real-time web-based ML application that predicts:
- Expected Salary based on job title, education, experience, and skills
- Job Level Classification (Junior / Mid / Senior)
- Provides a personalized salary insight report as downloadable PDF

Developed to solve the problem of compensation estimation for job applicants and HR teams, this project demonstrates a full ML pipeline: **data preparation ‚Üí model building ‚Üí deployment ‚Üí reporting.

##  Problem Statement

In today's fast-evolving job market, employees and hiring teams struggle to assess:
- Whether a candidate is underpaid or overpaid
- What job level matches their profile
- How to transparently present compensation decisions

This leads to:
- Pay inequality
- Mismatched expectations
- Inefficient hiring and internal promotions

SmartPayPro addresses this by using historical salary data and AI models to provide accurate, unbiased compensation benchmarks and job level predictions.
